Hello and welcome! I'm Bo Wu (武博), a Bachelor of Finance graduate from [Beijing International Studies University](http://en.bisu.edu.cn/index.html) under the mentorship of [Prof. Hua Zhu](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Hua-Zhu/2115717502). Graduating 5th in a cohort of 50, I excelled in courses such as Real Analysis and Financial Econometrics with guidance from [Prof. Jia Zhai](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Jia-Zhai/2717495). My internships at [CITIC Securities](https://www.cs.ecitic.com/newsite/en/) and [Grant Thornton](https://www.grantthornton.cn/) provided me with valuable, hands-on experience in market research and auditing.

Additionally, I honed my analytical and research skills through projects in quantitative analysis and mathematical modeling led by [Prof. Xueqi Wang](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Xueqi-Wang/50141387). Utilizing tools like Matlab, Python, and R, I deepened my understanding of economic impacts and policy evaluations. With a passion for quantitative finance, I am now preparing to pursue graduate studies to further advance my expertise in this dynamic field.


Feel free to contact me!
