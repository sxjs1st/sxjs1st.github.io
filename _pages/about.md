Hello and welcome! I'm Wuwei Yuan, a junior student at the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS, aka. Yao Class)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University. 

My main research interest lies in graph algorithms and other topics within theoretical computer science. 

As part of my ongoing academic journey, I'm currently visiting [Thatchaphol Saranurak](https://sites.google.com/site/thsaranurak/?pli=1) at the University of Michigan. 

Feel free to contact me!
