I like things that are fast in general: 
- Mathematics and Physics
- Sports: running, cycling, swimming(I used to be a competitive swimmer), skiing(beginner), and probably more
- Formula One: I’m a fan of Charles Leclerc and the Ferrari team. I really admire his driving skills and how he represents Ferrari with such passion and determination.
- Starship and other rockets

Meanwhile, I really like Arsenal and Barcelona—they’re my two favorite football clubs. **Bukayo Saka** and **Pedri** are the players I admire the most for their talent, creativity, and the energy they bring to the game.

Here's a glance at some of the other things I've been involving in outside of my primary academic focus:

## Sports

Outside of the academic world, I have a passion for triathlons. They provide a great way to stay fit and challenge myself physically and mentally. Here are some of my personal bests:
- Swimming:  
  - 50m freestyle: 31"40 (<span style="color:black">*4th place*</span> of group B at the BISU Swimming Competition, 2021)
  - 200m individual medley: 3'37"03 (&#129352;<span style="color:silver">*2nd place*</span> of group B at the BISU Swimming Competition, 2022)
- Cycling: None
- Running:
  - 1km: 3:23
  - 5km: 19:37
  - Half marathon: 1:53:48

Besides, I’m also a beginner in skiing and diving. In the 16th Beijing Higher Education Skiing Competition, I placed **8th** in the Men’s Snowboard Group B. As for diving, I mean the kind that involves jumping or falling into water from a platform or springboard.

## Music
I can play the piano and the drums a bit. Although I’m not a professional, I enjoy practicing in my free time, especially when I want to relax or express my emotions through music. I also like to listen to symphonies—they help me unwind and appreciate the beauty of classical music. The rich layers of sound and the emotion behind each piece always inspire me. Music plays an important role in my life, both as a hobby and as a source of comfort.

## Games
Two of my all-time favorite games are **Hearthstone** and **Resident Evil**. **Hearthstone** captivates me with its strategic depth—every match is a mental chess game, where creativity and foresight shape victory. It's more than just cards; it's a dynamic puzzle that constantly evolves. On the other hand, **Resident Evil** draws me in with its emotional storytelling and tense atmosphere. Ethan Winters’ unwavering love for his daughter Rosemary showcases profound sacrifice, while Leon S. Kennedy and Ashley Graham’s perseverance against overwhelming odds highlights courage and resilience. These games blend intellect and emotion in a way that leaves a lasting impact.

## Movies

My favorite movies are **Tenet** and **The Matrix**. I really enjoy films that explore complex ideas like time, reality, and human perception. Both movies have mind-bending plots, stunning visuals, and thought-provoking themes that make me want to watch them over and over again. I love how they challenge the way we think about the world and push the boundaries of science fiction.

## Food

I don't like:
- Spicy foods
- Sparkling water / soda
- Alcoholic drinks
- Coffee
- Tea
